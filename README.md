# Project-To-Do

In order to maintain my understanding of Coding + Current Coding Techniques I am using this Project A Week to keep ontop of Everything. These project can range from a short analysis of a dataset to different Theories / Write ups on modern used tools such as creating from scratch different ML techniques or Models, etc. I will hopefully keep this Organized Here.
